# Face-Following-with-OpenCV-and-Arduion
We try to write simple code for face tracing with arduino and a computer (optionally Raspberry pi).

First you have to connect your Arduino. İn the code you have to change 12'th line with your port adress. Also change the camera's number. For default use "0". 
for Serial connection you should download Serial library. 


This is my first Code for Github. İf i made something wrong please let me know.
